abstract = {This paper presents two challenges associated with using the ITU-T P.1203 standard for video quality monitoring in practice. We discuss the issue of unavailable data on certain browsers/platforms and the lack of information within newly developed data formats like Common Media Client Data. We also re-trained the coefficients of the P.1203.1 video model for newer codecs, and published a completely new model derived from the P.1204.3 bitstream model.},
