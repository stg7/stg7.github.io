  ABSTRACT="Popularity of streaming services for gaming videos has increased
  tremendously over the last years, e.g. Twitch and YoutubeGaming. Compared
  to classical video streaming applications, gaming videos have additional
  requirements. For example, it is important that videos are streamed live
  with only a small delay. In addition, users expect low stalling, waiting
  time and in general high video quality during streaming, e.g. using http
  based adaptive streaming. These requirements lead to different challenges
  for quality prediction in case of streamed gaming videos. We describe newly
  developed features and a no-reference video quality machine learning model,
  that uses only the recorded video to predict video quality scores. In
  different evaluation experiments, we compare our developed model that is
  called nofu, with state-of-the-art metrics, that are either reduced or full
  reference metrics. In addition, we trained a no-reference baseline model
  using brisque+niqe features. We show that our model has a similar or better
  performance than other metrics. Furthermore, nofu outperforms VMAF for
  subjective gaming QoE prediction, even though nofu does not require any
  reference video.",
