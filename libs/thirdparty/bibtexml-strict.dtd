<!-- Fields from the standard bibliography styles -->

<!--
  - Below is a description of all fields recognized by the standard
  - bibliography styles.  An entry can also contain other fields, which
  - are ignored by those styles.
  -
  - [address] Usually the address of the publisher or other type of
  - institution  For major publishing houses, van~Leunen recommends
  - omitting the information entirely.  For small publishers, on the other
  - hand, you can help the reader by giving the complete address.
  -
  - [annote] An annotation  It is not used by the standard bibliography
  - styles, but may be used by others that produce an annotated
  - bibliography.
  -
  - [author] The name(s) of the author(s), in the format described in the
  - LaTeX book.
  -
  - [booktitle] Title of a book, part of which is being cited.  See the
  - LaTeX book for how to type titles.  For book entries, use the title
  - field instead.
  -
  - [chapter] A chapter (or section or whatever) number.
  -
  - [crossref] The database key of the entry being cross referenced.
  -
  - [edition] The edition of a book-for example, ``Second''.  This
  - should be an ordinal, and should have the first letter capitalized, as
  - shown here; the standard styles convert to lower case when necessary.
  -
  - [editor] Name(s) of editor(s), typed as indicated in the LaTeX book.
  - If there is also an author field, then the editor field gives the
  - editor of the book or collection in which the reference appears.
  -
  - [howpublished] How something strange has been published.  The first
  - word should be capitalized.
  -
  - [institution] The sponsoring institution of a technical report.
  -
  - [journal] A journal name.  Abbreviations are provided for many
  - journals; see the Local Guide.
  -
  - [key] Used for alphabetizing, cross referencing, and creating a label
  - when the ``author'' information (described in Section [ref: ] is
  - missing. This field should not be confused with the key that appears
  - in the \cite command and at the beginning of the database entry.
  -
  - [month] The month in which the work was published or, for an
  - unpublished work, in which it was written  You should use the
  - standard three-letter abbreviation, as described in Appendix B.1.3 of
  - the LaTeX book.
  -
  - [note] Any additional information that can help the reader.  The first
  - word should be capitalized.
  -
  - [number] The number of a journal, magazine, technical report, or of a
  - work in a series.  An issue of a journal or magazine is usually
  - identified by its volume and number; the organization that issues a
  - technical report usually gives it a number; and sometimes books are
  - given numbers in a named series.
  -
  - [organization] The organization that sponsors a conference or that
  - publishes a manual.
  -
  - [pages] One or more page numbers or range of numbers, such as 42-111
  - or 7,41,73-97 or 43+ (the `+' in this last example indicates pages
  - following that don't form a simple range).  To make it easier to
  - maintain Scribe-compatible databases, the standard styles convert a
  - single dash (as in 7-33) to the double dash used in TeX to denote
  - number ranges (as in 7-33).
  -
  - [publisher] The publisher's name.
  -
  - [school] The name of the school where a thesis was written
  -
  - [series] The name of a series or set of books.  When citing an entire
  - book, the the title field gives its title and an optional series field
  - gives the name of a series or multi-volume set in which the book is
  - published.
  -
  - [title] The work's title, typed as explained in the LaTeX book.
  -
  - [type] The type of a technical report-for example, ``Research
  - Note''.
  -
  - [volume] The volume of a journal or multivolume book.
  -
  - [year] The year of publication or, for an unpublished work, the year
  - it was written.  Generally it should consist of four numerals, such as
  - 1984, although the standard styles can handle any year whose last four
  - nonpunctuation characters are numerals, such as `(about 1984)'.
